This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


There are `r nrow(cars)` rows and `r ncol(cars)` columns in the car dataset. 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
dim(cars)
message("Here are the dimensions.")
str(cars)
message("here is the structure.")
print("A new message")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, Industry_Univariate_Plots}
ggplot(data = companies, aes(x = industry)) +
    geom_bar() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, 
                                     hjust = 1))
```

The relationship between revenue in 2014 and growth appears to be strongly correlated based on the Pearson's r value, `r cor.test(companies$revenue2014, companies$growth_percentage)` for 2014 revenue and percentage growth, and for `r cor.test(companies$revenue2014, companies$growth_dollar)` for 2014 revenue and dollar growth.  

```{r}
subset(companies$industry, industry = "security")
```

# Common & Useful R commands 
## syntax for creating R chunks in RMD
```{r}
summary(mtcars)
```


## Directories
### Find current directory
getwd()
### Move to a different directory
setwd('/Users/horsepower/Dropbox/Udacity/NanoDA/EDAwithR/EDA_Course_Materials/lesson2')
### See all files in directory
list.files()

## CSV
reddit <- read.csv('reddit.csv')
*If the file is tab separated, there are two ways to import the data:*   
reddit <- read.csv('reddit.tsv', sep='\t')
reddit <- read.delim('reddit.tsv')

## Exploring data
Column names (in R times, see the variables):
names(reddit)
Find the dimensions (rows, columns)
dim(reddit)
Find the structure (columns, data types, example of values...)
str(reddit)
Descriptive stats on data, e.g. mean, median, & quartiles 
summary(reddit)

## Basic Plotting
### qplot
qplot(x = friend_count, data = pf)
(x is the x variable you want to display in the histogram)
### ggplot 
ggplot(aes(x = friend_count), data = pf) + 
  geom_histogram()

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

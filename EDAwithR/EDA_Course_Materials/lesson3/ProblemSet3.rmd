# 1. Explore dataset 
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data(diamonds) # diamonds dataset comes from ggplot2
summary(diamonds)
diamonds$color # prints out the colors for diamonds data set. 
# Levels: D < E < F < G < H < I < J signals the ordering of data
# Learn about diamonds dataset
?diamonds
```

# 2. Price Histogram

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Create a histogram of the price of
# all the diamonds in the diamond data set.

# TYPE YOUR CODE BELOW THE LINE
# =======================================
names(diamonds)
ggplot(aes(x = price), data = diamonds) +
    geom_histogram()
```

# 3. Price Histogram Summary

```{r}
summary(diamonds$price)
```

# 4. Diamond Counts
```{r}
summary(diamonds$price < 500)
summary(diamonds$price < 250)
summary(diamonds$price >= 15000)
```
1729, 0 , 1656

5. Cheaper Diamonds

```{r}
# Explore the largest peak in the
# price histogram you created earlier.

# Try limiting the x-axis, altering the bin width,
# and setting different breaks on the x-axis.

# There wonâ€™t be a solution video for this
# question so go to the discussions to
# share your thoughts and discover
# what other people find.

# You can save images by using the ggsave() command.
# ggsave() will save the last plot created.
# For example...
#                  qplot(x = price, data = diamonds)
#                  ggsave('priceHistogram.png')

# ggsave currently recognises the extensions eps/ps, tex (pictex),
# pdf, jpeg, tiff, png, bmp, svg and wmf (windows only).

# Submit your final code when you are ready.

# TYPE YOUR CODE BELOW THE LINE

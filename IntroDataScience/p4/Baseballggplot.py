    # contains two columns -- 'HR' (the number of homerun hits)
    # and 'yearID' (the year in which the homeruns were hit).
    #
    # Fill out the body of this function, lineplot, to use the
    # passed-in csv file, hr_year.csv, and create a
    # chart with points connected by lines, both colored 'red',

    # and use the pandas dataframe along with ggplot to create your visualization

    # You can check out the data in the csv file at the link below:

Analyzing the NYC Subway Dataset
Short Questions
Overview
This project consists of two parts. In Part 1 of the project, you should have completed the questions in Problem Sets 2, 3, 4, and 5 in the Introduction to Data Science course.This document addresses part 2 of the project. Please use this document as a template and answer the following questions to explain your reasoning and conclusion behind your work in the problem sets. You will attach a document with your answers to these questions as part of your final project submission.
Section 1. Statistical Test
1.1 Which statistical test did you use to analyse the NYC subway data? Did you use a one-tail or a two-tail P value? What is the null hypothesis?
The explotMann-Whitney U test - null hypothesis = two samples came from the same population
1.2 Why is this statistical test applicable to the dataset? In particular, consider the assumptions that the test is making about the distribution of ridership in the two samples.
1.3 What results did you get from this statistical test? These should include the following numerical values: p-values, as well as the means for each of the two samples under test.
1.4 What is the significance and interpretation of these results?
Section 2. Linear Regression
2.1 What approach did you use to compute the coefficients theta and produce prediction for ENTRIESn_hourly in your regression model:

Gradient descent (as implemented in exercise 3.5)
OLS using Statsmodels
Or something different?

2.2 What features (input variables) did you use in your model? Did you use any dummy variables as part of your features?
2.3 Why did you select these features in your model? We are looking for specific reasons that lead you to believe thatthe selected features will contribute to the predictive power of your model.Your reasons might be based on intuition. For example, response for fog might be: “I decided to use fog because I thought that when it is very foggy outside people might decide to use the subway more often.”Your reasons might also be based on data exploration and experimentation, for example: “I used feature X because as soon as I included it in my model, it drastically improved my R^2 value.”
2.4 What is your model’s R^2 (coefficients of determination) value?
2.5 What does this R^2 value mean for the goodness of fit for your regression model? Do you think this linear model to predict ridership is appropriate for this dataset, given this R^2 value?
Section 3. Visualization
Please include two visualizations that show the relationships between two or more variables in the NYC subway data. You should feel free to implement something that we discussed in class (e.g., scatter plots, line plots, or histograms) or attempt to implement something more advanced if you’d like.Remember to add appropriate titles and axes labels to yourplots. Also, please add a short description below each figure commenting on the
